# Project Plan: Identifying Optimal Locations for Co-Working Spaces in Baltimore City

## Introduction
The rise of remote work has fundamentally changed how people use and interact with workspace environments. Many remote workers face challenges such as limited space at home, distractions, and the need for professional settings to foster productivity and collaboration. This project aims to address these issues by identifying the most suitable locations for co-working spaces in Baltimore City, with a particular emphasis on creating community-owned and run co-working spaces that operate on a non-profit basis.

Establishing neighborhood co-working spaces can significantly enhance community well-being by providing accessible professional environments that meet the diverse needs of remote workers. These spaces not only provide a place to work but also serve as community hubs that promote social interaction and support local economies. By using grant money to convert vacant lots into vibrant co-working spaces, we aim to empower local communities, fostering a sense of ownership and pride.

Moreover, these spaces offer substantial environmental benefits. By reducing the need for long commutes, co-working spaces help lower carbon emissions and decrease traffic congestion. Research indicates that buildings account for 40% of societal energy use, and a single unused desk can generate a tonne of CO2 annually, equivalent to driving a car 6,000 miles. Utilizing local co-working spaces instead of centralized offices helps mitigate these environmental impacts.

Co-working spaces often incorporate energy-efficient practices such as using natural light, renewable energy sources, and low-energy HVAC systems. Many also promote waste reduction through recycling programs and the use of eco-friendly materials and products. Additionally, these spaces frequently support alternative transportation methods by providing bike storage, showers, and repair stations, further encouraging a reduction in car travel and its associated emissions.

Beyond environmental benefits, co-working spaces foster significant social advantages, especially for young families. They provide a built-in community of like-minded professionals, which can alleviate the isolation often associated with remote work. This community aspect is crucial for young parents who can share experiences, tips, and resources, thereby building valuable relationships that support both professional and personal development.

Co-working spaces also offer flexibility and a supportive environment for remote working parents. Many spaces organize social events and parenting workshops, providing opportunities to unwind, learn, and engage in community activities. These events strengthen community bonds and extend interactions beyond professional connections, creating a balanced and fulfilling work-life experience.

Furthermore, co-working spaces enhance mental health by satisfying basic human needs for relatedness and competence. The presence of others and opportunities for informal interactions can lead to the development of meaningful relationships and collaborations, fostering a sense of belonging and professional accomplishment.

In conclusion, by integrating green practices, reducing commute needs, and fostering a supportive community, co-working spaces not only support the productivity and well-being of remote workers but also contribute to broader environmental and social sustainability goals. This project will leverage these benefits to create a more resilient, eco-friendly, and socially supportive working environment for Baltimore City residents. All literature referenced in this project will be open-access to ensure that the findings and methodologies can be freely accessed and utilized by other researchers and community organizers.

## Project Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to leverage open data to pinpoint the best locations for new co-working spaces in Baltimore City. In doing so, we aim to foster a supportive environment for remote workers and small businesses. The project will involve analyzing a variety of data sources, developing criteria for site suitability, and effectively communicating our findings to stakeholders and decision-makers.

1. **Analyze Open Data**: Open data from the City of Baltimore, the State of Maryland, OpenStreetMap, and other relevant sources will be utilized. These data sources offer a wealth of information that can help identify locations with high potential for co-working spaces, such as areas with high population density, good public transportation links, and ample amenities.
2. **Develop Suitability Criteria**: The criteria for what makes a location suitable for a co-working space will be carefully defined and applied. These criteria include factors such as population density, proximity to public transportation, internet access, and nearby amenities. These factors are essential in ensuring that the chosen locations meet the needs of remote workers and small businesses.
3. **Communicate Findings**: The findings will be communicated through visualizations and reports to ensure that stakeholders and decision-makers can understand and act on the information.
